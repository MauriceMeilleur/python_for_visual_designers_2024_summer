# print() is a DrawBot 'function' that prints to the console; it needs at least one 'argument' or piece of information inside the parentheses to work: what to print

# this code creates a variable named 'myText' and assigns it the value of the string 'Hello world!' 
myText = 'Hello world!'
print(myText)

# note that Python is case-sensitive; if you try printing 'mytext' you'll see an error in red type in the console

# you can use anything you like for variable names as long as it's not a 'protected' name that Python/DrawBot would recognize as a command or function; it's good practice to name your variables succinctly and according to what you're going to use the information for

# DrawBot by default saves files with a .py extension to your desktop
