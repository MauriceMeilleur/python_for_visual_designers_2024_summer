# we're manually entering the list in the code, and we don't want the computer to read each new line as if it's a new line of code, so instead of using a single set of quotes to mark the string '' or "", we'll bracket the string with triple quotes

# this looks and prints like a list
print(ourNames)
# but in memory it's just one long string; see what happens when we try to print what looks like the first element in our list
print(ourNames[0])

# so let's redfine ourNames into a Python list object; we'll use the method (only for strings) split()
# we have to give split() an argument, namely on what we want the code to split the listâ€”here we'll tell it to split the list at each hard return; the string '\n' is an expression for the invisible character 'new line'
ourNames = ourNames.split('\n')
# now print ourNames again; now it's a list of strings, one for each name
print(ourNames)
print(ourNames[0])

# shuffle is a Python random function that gets installed with DrawBot; it randomizes the order of a sequence, like a list
