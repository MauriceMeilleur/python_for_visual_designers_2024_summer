# 22_pvd_chessboard

# let's put a bunch of things together now to draw a proper chessboard
# the convention for drawing chessboards in diagrams is to draw with Black at the top and White at the bottom, which means that the upper-left corner square is white

                    # note also that as far as the code is concerned, each square on the board is centered on the origin (0, 0) because we keep translating to each new position inside savedState() calls
