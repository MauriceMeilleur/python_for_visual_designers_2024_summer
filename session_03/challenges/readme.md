# Session 3 Challenges

## Clothing pattern

Find a plaid/argyle/polka dot/whatever pattern in your sweater drawer, in your house, or online and try to execute it in DrawBot.

Try to find where the pattern repeats and only draw a single instance of the repeating pattern. Then use a grid loop so you donâ€™t have to do more manual drawing than you have to. Bonus points for defining that repeating pattern as a function that you define, and then making a grid that simply calls the function.

## Custom image filter

Define a myCustomFilter() function that combines multiple ImageObject() filters, so that the following code works (or something like it).
```
myImage = ImageObject('image.jpg')  # make an image object from a file
myCustomFilter(myImage)             # pass the image object to our filter, which will modify it
newPage(*myImage.size())            # make a new page
image(myImage, (0, 0))              # draw the image
```

## Ring of shapes

Make a custom polygon (such as a triangle), and then draw concentric rings of that polygon, giving each ring a different color. I might suggest abstracting this into a few different steps:
make a function to represent your shape
make a function to represent a ring of shapes
then draw your document and make a loop of shape rings

## Bonus challenge for text: wedge shadow

Replicate the following instructions in code to make a wedge shadow; note that your sketch might not be in this order.

### Simple construction of a wedge shadow
* Set the word in black
* Turn the black to gray
* scale gray vertically 90% and backslant it 10 degrees
* place the black on gray by registering it at the baseline
