[Type@Cooper Public Workshop](https://coopertype.org/events/python-for-visual-designers-3)

Summer 2024

Instructor: Maurice Meilleur

Meetings: get in touch on our Slack

There’s a Slack workspace and Zoom link available only to students.

## Course description
Designers use tools to help us get our work done, but we rarely consider how much these tools can box us into certain processes and solutions in our work. Creating our own tools can lead us down new and unexpected avenues in our designs: some of the best visual ideas can come about by setting up some boundaries — a color palette, a typeface or two — and then running wild within the system. And working out a system in code is a great way to explore these ideas: computers love repetition and can quickly make hundreds of variations on a theme, and mistakes in the code can result in something that often looks better than what was originally intended.
No programming experience is necessary for this course, but students should be comfortable doing some arithmetic and basic geometry. Workshop participants will learn the basics of the Python programming language while working in the free DrawBot application for MacOS. A quick sketch made with code in DrawBot can be saved as a .pdf as a starting point to be finished later in Illustrator, or, with a little bit more work in the code editor, an entire book, magazine or animation can be built without even launching Illustrator or InDesign.
Using the fundamentals of the Python programming language, students will sketch to create vector art with code and use the basic principles of design to turn their sketches into PDF documents, animated .gifs, and videos.

## Required Materials
- A Mac running OS 10.9 (Mavericks) or later
- A fast enough internet connection for video calls
- This class will be held online, so using the Zoom desktop app is recommended

## Links & resources
DrawBot and Python documentation, as well as DrawBot script collections for you to try out and tweak. [Read more»](resources/resources.md)

## Credits
I owe a huge debt of gratitude to: Just van Rossum, who taught me how to write Python code; Andy Clymer; and [David Jonathan Ross](https://djr.com/)—all of whom have taught various versions of this course for Type@Cooper. The structure of our course this session closely matches DJR’s approach, and we’ll be using a lot of his and Just’s code.
